# WckdHax
A edit of [FabricHax](https://github.com/pranavgade20/FabricHax), A collection of Minecraft life hacks. 
I removed a lot of the stuff to keep it fair for survival servers that don't allow hacks.

## Installation
Download the latest jar file here [releases](link here) and put it in your mods folder.
You also need to get https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api in your mods folder.

## Usage
The mod has few modules active by default. You can access the full list of toggles using the keys `right_shift + r`.  
The GUI also has tabs for configuring the modules.

## Included modules
* **Auto Tool**: Scrolls the correct tool in your hotbar when you try to mine a block.
* **Farm Planter**: Places seeds on farmland. Just hold the seeds in your hand and go near farmland
* **Harvester**: Harvests mature crops near you. Just go near a mature crop to use
* **Freecam**: Spectator fly mode to look at your awesome builds. (Shortcut `right_shift + z`)
* **Walker**: Walk in a straight line, useful on nether roof. (Shortcut: `right_shift + w`)

## To do list
* **Fix Fullbright**: Currently doesn't work.
